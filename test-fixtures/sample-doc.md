# Trellix Series A Investment Memo

**Prepared by:** Jordan Kessler, CEO & Co-Founder
**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Confidential** -- Do not distribute outside the investment committee.

## Executive Summary

Trellix is an AI-powered workflow automation platform for mid-market professional services firms (50-500 employees). We replace fragmented stacks of spreadsheets, shared drives, and legacy project management tools with a single intelligent workspace that learns from each firm's operational patterns.

We are raising a $24M Series A at a $120M pre-money valuation to expand our go-to-market team, accelerate product development, and enter two new verticals (legal and accounting) beyond our current beachhead in management consulting.

The company was founded in March 2023 by Jordan Kessler (ex-Palantir, 8 years) and Priya Chandrasekaran (ex-Stripe, 6 years). We shipped our first production release in November 2023 and have been in market for 26 months.

## Market Opportunity

### Total Addressable Market

The global professional services automation market was valued at $12.8B in 2025 and is projected to reach $23.4B by 2030, representing a 12.8% CAGR. Within this space, the mid-market segment (our focus) accounts for roughly 38% of spend, or approximately $4.9B today.

Traditional incumbents like Mavenlink, Kantata, and Workday PSA serve primarily enterprise clients and are priced out of reach for firms under 500 employees. Smaller tools like Monday.com and Asana lack the domain-specific intelligence that professional services firms require, such as utilization tracking, client profitability analysis, and resource forecasting.

### Why Now

Three converging trends make this the right moment:

- **LLM commoditization:** Foundation model costs dropped 90% between 2023 and 2025, making it economically viable to embed AI deeply into workflow tools rather than bolting on a chatbot.
- **Mid-market tech adoption surge:** Post-pandemic, firms in the 50-500 range increased SaaS budgets by an average of 34% (Gartner, 2025), closing the digital maturity gap with enterprise peers.
- **Regulatory complexity:** New SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 requirements are pushing firms to consolidate tooling onto auditable platforms, replacing shadow IT.

## Traction & Key Metrics

We have grown rapidly since entering the market in late 2023. We believe these numbers demonstrate strong product-market fit in management consulting, our first vertical.

| Metric                       | Q1 2025 | Q2 2025 | Q3 2025 | Q4 2025 |
|------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| ARR ($M)                     | 2.1     | 3.0     | 4.2     | 5.8     |
| Paying customers             | 38      | 54      | 72      | 97      |
| Net revenue retention        | 118%    | 121%    | 124%    | 126%    |
| Gross margin                 | 71%     | 73%     | 74%     | 76%     |
| CAC payback (months)         | 14      | 13      | 11      | 10      |
| Monthly logo churn           | 2.4%    | 2.1%    | 1.7%    | 1.3%    |

ARR grew 176% year-over-year from $2.1M to $5.8M. Net revenue retention above 120% signals healthy expansion within existing accounts, driven primarily by seat upgrades and adoption of our analytics add-on module.

### Notable Customers

- Meridian Partners (210 employees, management consulting) -- $186K ACV, live since April 2024
- Northbridge Advisory Group (95 employees) -- $72K ACV, expanded 2x within 6 months
- StrattonHaus (340 employees, operational consulting) -- $224K ACV, replaced Kantata

## Product Overview

Trellix consists of three integrated modules:

### Workspace (Core)

Real-time project boards, document collaboration, and task management purpose-built for engagement-based work. Unlike generic tools, every object in Trellix is linked to a client, engagement, and billing code by default.

### Forecast Engine

A predictive staffing and utilization model trained on historical engagement data. It recommends optimal team compositions, flags over- or under-utilization two weeks in advance, and generates scenario plans when scope changes occur. Customers using Forecast Engine report a 15% improvement in billable utilization on average.

### Insights Dashboard

Client profitability, team performance, and pipeline health in a single view. The dashboard pulls data from Workspace and Forecast Engine and overlays benchmarks from anonymized, aggregated peer data (opt-in). Firms using Insights are 2.3x more likely to upgrade to an annual contract.

## Financial Plan

### Use of Proceeds

The $24M raise will fund approximately 24 months of runway at planned burn rates:

- **Engineering (45% -- $10.8M):** Grow the team from 14 to 32 engineers. Key hires include a VP of Engineering, a machine learning lead, and a platform security architect.
- **Sales & Marketing (35% -- $8.4M):** Build out an outbound sales team (8 AEs, 4 SDRs), invest in content marketing and events targeting legal and accounting verticals.
- **G&A and Operations (20% -- $4.8M):** Office lease (SF and London), finance/HR tooling, legal costs for international expansion, and working capital buffer.

### Revenue Projections

Based on current pipeline, expansion trends, and planned vertical launches:

- **2026 target ARR:** $14.5M (150% growth)
- **2027 target ARR:** $32M (120% growth)
- **2028 target ARR:** $58M (81% growth)

We expect to reach cash-flow breakeven in Q3 2028 at approximately $50M ARR, assuming gross margins stabilize around 78% and operating expenses grow at roughly 40% annually from 2027 onward.

### Burn & Runway

Current monthly burn is $680K. Post-raise, we project peak monthly burn of $1.1M in Q4 2026 as new hires ramp. With $24M in new capital plus $3.2M in existing cash reserves, total runway extends to approximately 26 months from close.

## Competitive Landscape

We segment competitors into three tiers:

- **Enterprise PSA platforms (Kantata, Workday PSA, SAP):** Strong feature depth but 12-18 month implementation cycles, $300K+ ACV floors, and limited AI capabilities. Not viable for mid-market firms.
- **Horizontal project tools (Asana, Monday, Notion):** Low price points and fast onboarding, but no professional-services domain logic. Firms outgrow them quickly once they need utilization tracking or client profitability views.
- **Emerging vertical SaaS (Mosaic, Parallax, Runn):** Closest competitors. These tools address resource planning but lack the integrated workspace and AI engine. We believe our all-in-one approach and data flywheel create a durable moat.

Our primary differentiation is the feedback loop between Workspace usage data and the Forecast Engine. The more a firm uses Trellix, the more accurate its predictions become -- a compounding advantage that point solutions cannot replicate.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Vertical expansion execution risk.** Legal and accounting workflows differ from consulting. Mitigation: We are hiring domain experts for each vertical and plan limited beta programs (5 firms each) before broad launch.
- **LLM dependency.** Core AI features rely on third-party models (OpenAI, Anthropic). Mitigation: Abstraction layer supports model swapping; we also train lightweight proprietary models for latency-sensitive features.
- **Mid-market sales cycle unpredictability.** Deals can stall due to budget freezes or champion departures. Mitigation: Diversified pipeline (no single deal > 5% of projected ARR) and product-led growth motion for smaller accounts.

| Sana Okafor             | Head of Product      | Figma, Notion (7 yr combined)                |
| Rachel Tan              | Head of ML           | Google DeepMind (4 yr), PhD NeurIPS published |

Total headcount: 42 (14 engineering, 10 sales/CS, 8 product/design, 10 G&A). We plan to reach 78 by end of 2026.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Current Motion (Consulting Vertical)

Our sales process today is primarily inbound-led. Content marketing (case studies, ROI calculators, webinars) drives 65% of qualified pipeline. The remaining 35% comes from partner referrals through consulting industry associations such as AMCF and the Institute of Management Consultants.

Average sales cycle is 47 days from first demo to signed contract. Deals under $80K ACV close through a self-serve trial with sales assist; deals above $80K involve a solutions engineer and typically require a security review.

### Vertical Expansion Playbook (Legal & Accounting)

We plan to enter legal services in Q2 2026 and accounting in Q4 2026, following a repeatable playbook:

1. **Hire a vertical lead** with 10+ years of domain experience and an existing network.
2. **Recruit 5 design partners** for a 90-day closed beta at 50% discount.
3. **Build vertical-specific templates** (matter management for legal, engagement letters and audit workflows for accounting).
4. **Launch with co-branded case studies** from beta participants to seed credibility.

We estimate each new vertical adds approximately $1.2M in incremental ARR within 12 months of launch, ramping to $4-5M by month 24.

## Appendix: Key Assumptions

- Average ACV grows from $60K today to $85K by 2028 as we move upmarket within mid-market.
- Sales headcount productivity: each ramped AE generates $1.2M in new ARR annually.
- Gross margin improvement driven by shifting inference workloads to fine-tuned smaller models (estimated 30% cost reduction per query by Q3 2026).
- Net revenue retention remains above 115% as product surface area expands.
- International revenue (UK/EU) contributes 15% of new bookings by 2027.

## Decision and Ask

We are requesting $24M on a $120M pre-money valuation, structured as a priced Series A round with standard protective provisions and a single new board seat. Target close: March 15, 2026.

Participating investors in this round will gain exposure to a fast-growing vertical SaaS company with demonstrated product-market fit, strong unit economics, and a clear path to $50M+ ARR. We believe the combination of an expanding market, AI-native architecture, and disciplined execution positions Trellix to become the category-defining platform for mid-market professional services.
