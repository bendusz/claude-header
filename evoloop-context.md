# Evoloop — Master Context Document
> Reference file for AI coaching sessions. Last updated: February 21, 2026.
> Written by: Business Coach AI, based on conversation with Ben.

---

## 1. Who Is Ben

- **Full name:** Ben (surname not provided)
- **Age:** 36
- **Location:** Glasgow, Scotland
- **Current job:** Systems Administrator at Autorek (finishing March 27, 2026)
- **Next job:** Starts at DATAVITA on March 30, 2026
- **Salary:** £47k/year currently
- **Technical skills:** Systems engineering, Linux, Docker, Proxmox, Terraform, Azure, Intune, NinjaRMM, Wazuh, Tenable, Veeam, Snipe-IT, PowerShell, API integration, networking, hardware, n8n, RAG systems, AI agents, Leaflet.js, web development
- **Real job scope at Autorek (understated title):** Single-handedly ran IT infrastructure for 200+ employees across 3 offices. Designed hybrid Azure infrastructure, full Intune rollout, complete networking overhaul, server management, GRC, security operations, audit work, procurement, supplier management, stakeholder management at C-level. Effectively Head of IT + Security Engineer + Cloud Architect in one person.
- **Why leaving Autorek:** 3 years of carrying a 3-4 person workload alone, company doubled, no support added, burnt out, exploited.
- **Personal situation:** Engaged to Fru (future wife). 3 dogs. Sneaker collector. Homelab enthusiast. Sees therapist weekly (Tuesdays). At emotional breaking point but stable and functional.
- **Personal financial pressure:** PT costs £600/month, gym 4x/week, wedding in Croatia end of September (£3-4k), citizenship for both (£3-4k), budget maxed. If DATAVITA requires Fru to quit her job, finances collapse.
- **Network:** Very poor. Self-described antisocial history. LinkedIn presence minimal but professional. No warm business network in Glasgow.
- **Capital available:** £5,000 startup capital confirmed. Credit line up to £40k (not to be used unless business is proven).

## 2. The Business: Evoloop

### 2.1 Core Identity
- **Trading name:** Evoloop
- **Legal entity:** PARANET.UK Ltd (30+ year old company, originally founded in Hungary by Jani and Eva)
- **Invoicing convention:** "Evoloop, trading as PARANET.UK Ltd"
- **Website:** evoloop.ai
- **Email:** contact@evoloop.ai
- **Location:** Glasgow, Scotland
- **Stage:** Pre-revenue. Pre-launch. Launching March 2026.

### 2.2 What Evoloop Does
Three service pillars:
1. **AI Automation** — chatbots, document processing, email triage, knowledge bases, workflow automation
2. **AI Security** — data protection, compliance, governance for AI adoption
3. **Managed IT Services** — proactive monitoring, helpdesk, cloud management, infrastructure

### 2.3 Target Market
- Scottish SMEs, primarily Glasgow and Central Scotland
- Micro and small businesses: 5-50 employees
- Sectors: dental, legal, accountancy, trades, professional services
- Decision maker: Owner/MD willing to invest £2,000-15,000 to save 10+ hours/week
- Key insight: 75% of Scottish SMEs not yet using AI. #1 barrier is "I don't know where to start."

### 2.4 Unique Positioning
- Only Glasgow provider combining AI + MSP for micro-SMEs
- 30 years IT heritage through PARANET.UK
- Ben's DATAVITA connection (building Scotland's £8.2bn AI Growth Zone)
- Practical engineers not consultants: "We don't sell strategy decks, we build working automations"
- Can undercut London agencies by 40-60%

### 2.5 Competitive Landscape
- **Highest threat:** SilverCloud (Scotland's leading MSP, partnered with Illuminate AI — but enterprise-leaning)
- **Medium threat:** Certum, Incovo, Insightful AI (Warrington), EH2.AI (Edinburgh)
- **Key gap:** No Glasgow MSP currently leads with integrated AI services for small businesses

---

## 3. Team Reality (UPDATED — Critical)

### Original Plan (Now Invalid)
The business plan assumed a 5-person family team: Ben (founder/sales/delivery), Fru (marketing), Eva (finance), Jani (MSP/infrastructure), Johnny (junior).

### Actual Reality
**Ben is completely solo.** Family has shown no interest or engagement since documents were created. Fru created the logo but has not delivered on any other commitments despite repeated nudging. Eva, Jani, and Johnny have not engaged.

### Implications
- All planning must be rebuilt for a solo founder
- Automation and AI agents are not nice-to-have — they ARE the team
- Ben's 20 hours/week post-DATAVITA is the single most constrained resource
- The business story shifts: "I run my business the way I build yours — automated, lean, efficient"

---

## 9. Timeline Overview

| Period | Situation |

| March 30 onwards | DATAVITA starts. 2-3hrs weekday evenings + 4-8hrs weekends for Evoloop |
| Month 6 (Aug 2026) | Decision point: is model proven? |
| Month 11-12 | If MRR > £5,000: give DATAVITA notice |

---

## 10. Website Issues Identified (Feb 21, 2026)

**Critical problems found and being fixed:**
1. Fake live performance dashboard (12,847 queries, 340h saved, 99.2% accuracy) — must be removed or labelled as targets
2. Unsubstantiated results claims (£50K dental recovery, 80% construction time reduction) — must be labelled as projected/industry-based or removed until real case studies exist
3. Plural "engineers" and "our team" language — must reflect solo founder reality
4. Original SPA architecture invisible to Google — being replaced with static/SSR

---

## 11. Coaching Decisions & Conventions

- **Ben's role description to use on LinkedIn:** "Designed and built hybrid Azure infrastructure, led full Intune and NinjaRMM deployment, managed GRC and security operations, and modernised IT across 3 offices for a 200+ person fintech company — as a solo practitioner." (All factually accurate)
- **Never use:** "Systems Administrator" as primary descriptor — it undersells massively
- **Business persona:** Solo technical founder who automates his own business the same way he builds client solutions
- **Credit line rule:** £40k exists as safety net only. Not a spending budget.
- **Personal rule agreed:** Business gets best hours. Not 2am desperate hours. Dogs > laptop when it gets dark mentally.
- **LinkedIn strategy:** Daily discipline, not occasional inspiration. Primary network substitute.
- **SEO priority:** Get indexed first. Perfect content second.
- **Sales approach:** Free AI Readiness Assessment as lead magnet (via Calendly)
- **Referral strategy:** Accountants and solicitors serving Glasgow SMEs as primary referral partners

---

## 12. Red Flags / Risks to Monitor

1. **Ben's bandwidth** — solo founder with full-time job is the #1 execution risk
2. **DATAVITA contract** — read immediately on arrival for non-compete/IP clauses
3. **Personal wellbeing** — Ben at emotional breaking point. Therapy Tuesdays. Must protect energy.
4. **Relationship pressure** — financial and personal pressure from home situation. Not resolved.
5. **No warm network** — pipeline must be built from scratch. This takes longer than the plan assumes.
6. **AI Scotland Fund deadline** — March 2026. Missing it is a significant lost opportunity.
7. **Misleading website claims** — being fixed today. Must not do outreach until clean.
